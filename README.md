# Digital Health with the new E-ID trust infrastructure
_-Decentralization of the electronic patient medical record_

Let's build in 30 hours a whole SSI infrastructure üïµÔ∏è

Components:
- **An issuer**: made in Java, to issue medical records as **verifiable credentials**
- **An iPhone holder app**: made in Swift, to store your medical verifiable credentials
- **An iPad verifier app**: made in Swift, to receive a selection of verifiable credentials sent by the holder. To be presented as an "historical view of my patient medical record"
- **A verifier back-end**: API made in python, data storage hosted on Directus. To have a back-end between the holder app and the verifier app to share data.
- **An Azure infrastructure**: To build, deploy and host the isser and verifier part üöÄ
